'''
A Hamming number is a positive integer of the form 2i3j5k, for some non-negative integers i, j, and k.

Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming number.

Specifically:

The first smallest Hamming number is 1 = 203050
The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 213050
The third smallest Hamming number is 3 = 203150
The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 = 223050
The fifth smallest Hamming number is 5 = 203051
The 20 smallest Hamming numbers are given in the Example test fixture.

Your code should be able to compute the first 5 000 ( LC: 400, Clojure: 2 000, NASM, C, D, C++, Go and Rust: 13 282 ) Hamming numbers without timing out.
