We have a string s

We have a number n

Here is a function that takes your string, concatenates the even-indexed chars to the front, odd-indexed chars to the back.

Examples
s = "Wow Example!"
result = "WwEapeo xml!"
s = "I'm JomoPipi"
result = "ImJm ii' ooPp"
The Task:
return the result of the string after applying the function to it n times.

example where s = "qwertyuio" and n = 2:

after 1 iteration  s = "qetuowryi"
after 2 iterations s = "qtorieuwy"
return "qtorieuwy"
Note
there's a lot of tests, big strings, and n is greater than a billion

so be ready to optimize.
